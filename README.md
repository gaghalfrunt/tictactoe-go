# Tic Tac Toe in Go

## Introduction

Uses [`gpm`](https://github.com/pote/gpm) for dependency management and [`gvp`](https://github.com/pote/gvp)  for easier `$GOPATH` and [Workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) handling.


## Run the Game

Before running the game, make sure to download and install all dependencies, with
```
gpm init
```

Then set the current workspace for Go with
```
source gvp in
```
